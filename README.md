# The Better Context App

This is an evolution of: https://github.com/bmdavis419/opencode-hosted-docs-nonsense. Eventually I want to have this be the easiest way to pass in a piece of tech (ie. Svelte) and a question (ie. "How do remote functions work?") and get an up to date answer based on the latest version of the tech using the latest version of the docs/source code...

**_this is all scratch work right now, I'll remove this once it's more ready to go_**
