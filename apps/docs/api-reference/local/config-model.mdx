title: "Update provider model"
openapi: "PUT /config/model"
---

Updates the active provider and model.

For `openai-compat`, include `providerOptions` with `baseURL` and `name` so the server can
construct the OpenAI-compatible provider. The `model` field remains required and is used as the
model ID when sending requests.
