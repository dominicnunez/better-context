btca exposes two HTTP surfaces:

- **Local server API**: runs on your machine, no authentication required.
- **Cloud API**: hosted services that require a Bearer API key.

Use the navigation to browse endpoints. Each page is backed by OpenAPI and
includes live schemas.

## Authentication

- Local server: no auth.
- Cloud API: `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>`.
